The latest patch has shaken up the TFT meta significantly, with several new compositions emerging and old favorites getting reworked. This comprehensive guide will walk you through everything you need to know to climb in the current patch.

## Top Tier Compositions

**Key Items:** Jinx carries with AD items
**Play Pattern:** Fast 8 to hit Jinx 2-star

2. **Level 4 Timing:** Don't greed too hard, strength is key
3. **Item Flexibility:** Build items that work across multiple carries

## Mid Game Transitions

Understanding when and how to pivot is crucial:

- Scout opponents to avoid contested comps

    content: `# Beginner's Guide to TFT Rolling Odds

Understanding rolling odds is fundamental to success in TFT. This guide will teach you everything you need to know about when to roll and when to save gold.

## The Basics

Rolling odds determine what units you'll see in your shop. Each level has different probabilities for each unit cost.

## When to Roll

- When you need specific upgrades to survive
- When you have excess gold above 50
- When your board is weak for your stage

## When to Level

- To unlock higher cost units
- To increase your board size
- When you have a strong economy

## Gold Management Tips

1. Always try to maintain 50+ gold for interest
2. Don't roll just because you can
3. Plan your power spikes around levels 7 and 8`,

- Focus on learning

## Long-Term Improvement

Set process goals, not just rank goals.

### Review Habits
Spend time analyzing your games.

### Continuous Learning
Stay updated with meta changes.

## Building Consistency

- Solid fundamentals
- Flexible gameplay
- Good decision making`,
